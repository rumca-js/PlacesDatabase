        "description": "<p>Hi HN, I've been working on this Sudoku web app for the past couple of years, on and off during free weekends and afternoons. I started working on it because I was bored during COVID, and Cracking the Cryptic had just become popular on YouTube, which got me wondering how hard it could be to make a Sudoku app. The main idea is for the app to understand the constraints and know how to solve Sudoku grids (and not just be a simple Sudoku drawing/playing app). When it comes to classic Sudoku, the solver doesn't support anything more complicated than X-Wing, but it understands the constraints.<p>At the moment, most of the popular variants are supported: killer, sandwich, arrow, thermo, palindrome, German whisper, kropki, consecutive, non-consecutive, greater than, XV, diagonal, anti-king, anti-knight, even-odd, windoku, renban, and zipper. The only variant I am yet to add support for is quadruple. If any other variant becomes popular, I will probably add it, as was the case with zipper ",
