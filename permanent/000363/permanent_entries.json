Through a wide variety of courses and programming in the humanities, arts, and social sciences, we take up the broader concerns of Africana Studies as a field, merge them with our dynamic faculty expertise and interests, and combine them with the educational needs of our diverse student population to encourage multi and interdisciplinary research, writing, and analysis. Even as intellectual rigor is a significant programmatic focus, we also recognize the importance of grounding intellectual engagement with activism and life experience, and we assist students in finding unique and compelling perspectives from which to pursue and to make their own contributions to the field of Africana Studies.",

Following tremendous hardship after being forced from their valued homelands, they continued as a sovereign Tribal Nation in Wisconsin, which is where they reside today.

        "description": "Founded in 1946, the Political Economy Program offers the oldest interdepartmental major at the College. The program was designed to give its students an understanding of the many ways that politics and economics interact in the formation of public policy. Majors acquire a substantial mastery of economics, broad knowledge of the American and international political context, an understanding of the economic and moral stakes in key current public policy issues, and the opportunity to analyze policy for themselves. The major is notable for its high degree of structure, with requirements in Economics and Political Science, along with three distinctive core courses. These courses -- POEC 250, 401, and 402 are each usually taught jointly by an economist and a political scientist. The first, Economic Liberalism and Its Critics, considers major thinkers from Adam Smith onward. We discuss moral issues of political economy, such as the justification and distribution of private property, author",

        "description": "Political science is interested in the question of power\u2014how it is created, exercised, justified, and challenged to engage in problem solving, facilitate citizen action, and participate in world-making. Political scientists\u00a0study democracy, war, group conflicts, law, rights, wealth distribution, and authority, as well as the individuals, institutions, and social forces that shape them. As a social science, the study of politics considers both the dynamics and ethics of power, which in turn involves conceptions of community, identity, justice, and citizenship. The contests over power and the values that should animate it imbue politics with\u00a0drama as well as\u00a0pathos. Naturally, then, the effort to understand politics aims not only to describe and explain, but also to improve collective life. To this end, the Political Science Department strives to cultivate in its students the habits and skills of clear thought, rigorous analysis, and effective argumentation in writing and speech. _____",

Throughout this evolution The Log has continued to hold special meaning for alumni, full of both memorabilia and memories.

During this interlude between semesters, students have time to immerse themselves in an interest of their choosing. Winter Study offerings promote one or more of the following: Experiential, hands-on learning (craft, literacy, fluency, research); Self-expression (art, performing arts and languages); Student exploration (academic, global, career, independent projects, research); and Wellness (mindfulness, health, life-planning). Students can travel across the globe; intern or apprentice in a field of interest; pursue independent research; or enroll in on-campus courses on topics not covered during the regular semester. Most offerings do not have prerequisites, so students can interact and collaborate with peers who hold different perspectives and interests. Students will also have the opportunity ",
